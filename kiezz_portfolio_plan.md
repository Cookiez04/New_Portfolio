## üë§ About Me
- **Visual:** Mascot/avatar (AI-generated later, style TBD)
- **Bio (Refined):**
  > Hey, I‚Äôm Kiezz (Ahmad Zuhairy). By day I work at UTeM, building ASP.NET apps and keeping databases from falling apart. Outside of that I like making things that are either useful or just plain fun. I built Kira, a personal finance tracker that makes sense the way I think about money. I also play around with random experiments like a 3D solar system you can spin around or patterns that move and grow on their own. Sometimes it‚Äôs serious, sometimes it‚Äôs just me messing around, but I enjoy building things I can use or share.
  >
  > I believe the best code balances serious functionality with a touch of personality. Whether I'm debugging enterprise systems or creating interactive art, I approach every project with curiosity and a healthy dose of humor. Because why settle for boring when you can build something that works *and* sparks joy?
